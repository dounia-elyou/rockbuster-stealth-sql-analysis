# Top 10 Countries for Rockbuster in Terms of Customer Numbers

## Description
This SQL query identifies the top 10 countries for Rockbuster based on the number of customers. The query uses `INNER JOIN` to connect the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables, ensuring that only countries with customers are included. It groups the data by country and counts the number of customers per country. The results are then sorted in descending order and limited to the top 10 countries.
